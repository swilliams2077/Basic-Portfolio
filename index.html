        <p class="text"> My name is Shakwan Yumon Williams. I am as creative as it gets and my creativity doesn't show any bias. As you'll see
            my talents. hobbies, and ambitions overlap and fuel one another. I am as much as a writer as I am artist, as much of spiritual journalist
            as I am programmer. I make music that complements the visual elements I use while story telling. My mind is flowing with ideas and nothing is 
            left off the table. Just a little about me.
